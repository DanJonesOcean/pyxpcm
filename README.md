Python Profile Classification Modelling for Xarray
==================================================

**Profile Classification Modelling** is an scientific analysis approach based on vertical profiles classification that can be used in a variety of oceanographic problems (front detection, water mass identification, natural region contouring, reference profile selection for validation, etc ...).

It is being developed at Ifremer/LOPS with collaboration with Telecom Bretagne since 2015 and is now mature enough (with publication and communications) to be distributed and made available publicly for continuous improvements with a community development.
