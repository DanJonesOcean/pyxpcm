Profile Classification Modelling: Methodology
=============================================

Here I describe with more details the statistics behind PCM.

**Ocean dynamics** and its 3-dimensional structure and variability is so complex that it is very difficult to develop objective and efficient diagnostics of horizontally and vertically coherent oceanic patterns. However, identifying such **patterns** is crucial to the understanding of interior mechanisms as, for instance, the integrand giving rise to Global Ocean Indicators (e.g. heat content and sea level rise). We believe that, by using state of the art **machine learning** algorithms and by building on the increasing availability of ever-larger **in situ and numerical model datasets**, we can address this challenge in a way that was simply not possible a few years ago. Following this approach, **Profile Classification Modelling** focuses on the smart identification of vertically coherent patterns and their spatial distribution.
